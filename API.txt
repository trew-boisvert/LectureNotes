Application Programming Interface
  How we interact with something
Provide info and capabilities to developers
Important to read API documentation to figure out if it's what you need
RESTful API - Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface
  Set of standards for API architecture
  URLs are uniform and meaningful
  Client and server are independent of each other
    Can be different languages
  HTTP(S) is the protocol
  Each request is independent
  Consistent, predictable and meaningful endpoint naming is important
  Use hierarchy in designing endpoints to help stay organized (ex. /albums ==> /albums/<id> ==> /albums/<id>/tracks
Streaming APIs passively listen to you and are constantly active (ex. Twitter)
Accessing data
  Look for documentation
    Lists available endpoints
    How to format
    Rate Limits
      Per minute, hour, day, lifetime, IP address, User ID
  Authentication
    To track requests
    Generate analytics
    Require permission
    
Postman
  Tool lets us test out APIs
  Layout -
