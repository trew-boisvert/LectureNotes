Client-Server Model
Endpoints
  Where we define how our server can be interacted with
Node.js
  A JavaScript runtime environment
    Allows us to run JavaScript in an environment outside of the browser, like on our terminals
    Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
    Use commande 'node' in terminal
      Can follow with file name to run file
  Nodemon
    Node only runs file once
    Package that watches files and restarts Node for us
    To install, run "npm install -g nodemon"
    Use command 'nodemon file.name' to run file
  NPM
    Node Package Manager
    Gives access to packages and libraries
    Use 'npm init -y' to set up project
  Express
    Minimal, flexible framework for building servers
    Fast, unopinionated, minimalist
    Must be required/imported
