Solving a Maze Coding Challenge
  1. Hardcode solution for a particular maze
  2. Las Vegas Algorithm - 
    Pick randomly at every junction
  3. Left Hand On Wall - 
    Not most efficient
    Guaranteed to work
    If you can turn left, turn left.  If you can move forward, move forward, otherwise turn right.

Refactoring
  Consider writing controller files (Javascript) to handle separate concerns.  
  Consider decorators to handle repeated concerns (ex. check if user is logged in to view page) (Python)

Common Approach to Problem-solving
  Make it work, make it fast, make it beautiful.
