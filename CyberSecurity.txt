Cryptography -
  Techniques for secure communication
  Plaintext is the original message
  Ciphertext is the enciphered message
  Caesar Cipher -
    Shift each letter by 3, Z wraps back to A
    Very easy to crack
  Using a key helps increase security
  Brute Force - 
    "Breaking" a code by trying all possible combinations
  Digital Algorithms -
    DES -
      56-bit key
      No longer safe
    Triple-DES - 
      118-bit key length
      DES three times in a row
      Slow but secure
    AES - 
      Has three key lengths (128, 192, 256)
      Extremely secure
  Public Key Encryption - 
    Public Key and Private Key
    Things encrypted with public key can be decrypted by private key, and vice versa
    RSA algorithm is a trap door function
      Uses math operations that are easy to do forward but difficult to do backwards
    Asymmetric and Symmetric encryption are often used together
  Hashes - 
    No way to turn number back into full file
    Any change to file will result in different hash
    Good for checking that file hasn't been changed
  HTTPS Protocol - 
    Client suggests asymmetric and symmetric method to use together
    Server gives public key and certificate verifying server is not fake
    Client gives session key encoded with public key
    Server decodes session key using its private key
    Client encrypts request with session key
    Server encrypts reply with session key
  OAuth / APIs
    When one website lets you authenticate using your credentials from a different website
    OAuth needs - 
      Your access token
      Timestamp
      Nonce (random string, never re-used)
      Hash of everything above
      
      This proves when request was made, 
        that it was made by you,
        that nothing was changed, 
        and prevents re-using a request
  SSH - 
    Gets a remote terminal set up on server
    Secure Shell
    Public key on server, private key on laptop
    Server keeps list of allowed public keys
Security Vulnerabilities -
  OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project https://owasp.org/
    Non-profit working to improve software security
    Major threats to websites - 
      SQL Injection - 
        Need to validate, filter, or sanitize user-supplied data
        Keep data separate from commands and queries
        Use safe API or ORMs
      Broken Authetntication - 
        Happens when website 
          allows unlimited login attempts, 
          permits weak passwords
          uses weak credential recovery
        To protect against it
          Use multi-factor authentication
          Require complex passwords
          Limit or delay failed login attempts
        Credential Stuffing - 
          Hacker tries to brute force access by trying a bunch of user names and passwords
      Broken Access Control - 
        Certain features only accessible to certain users
        Weak websites can be hacked by editing the URL
        To protect against - 
          Deny access to features by default
          Use access control mechanisms
