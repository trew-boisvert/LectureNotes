Interpreted Language
It's important to use consistent indentation, or you will get an indentation error

Primitive Data Types
  Int
    A whole number
    Can convert a float to an int with int()
  Float
    A number with decimals
    Can convert an int to a float with float()
  String
    Strings store text
    Can be marked with single quotes or double quotes
    If you want to use a quote inside a string, you need to escape that character
    Strings can be concatenated using a +
  Boolean
    Stores a True or False value

Lists
  An iterable collection of values
  Zero-indexed
  An item's index is it's location in the list
  Created using square brackets
Dictionaries
  Stores keys connected to values in key value pairs
  If you look for a key that isn't in a dictionary, you can get a Key error
    Value of non-existent key is None
    
Comparators
  Less than <
  Less than or equal to <=
  Equal ==
  Greater than or equal to >=
  Greater than >
  Not equal !=
  
Logical Operators
  Or

Basic functions and methods
  print()
    Print to the screen
  input()
    Used to collect input from user
    Input is saved as a string
  range()
    Generates a sequence of numbers, starting at zero, unless otherwise specified
    Can provide start, stop, and step as parameters
  .append()
    Used to add values to list

Loops
  syntax:
    for elem in listOrDictionary:
      code here
  If you loop over a dictionary, only the values will be printed 
    Can get key and value with this syntax:
      for key, value in dictionaries.items():
        code here
